+ = increment the cell over the pointer by 1
- = decrement the cell over the pointer by 1
. = output the current cell as an ascii character
: = output the current cell as an integer
? = output the current cell as binary
, = accept one byte of input
< = decrement the pointer
> = increment the pointer
[ = jump past the matching ']' if the cell at the pointer is 0
] = jump back to the matching '[' if the cell at the pointer is nonzero
/ = jump past the matching '|' if the length of the input queue is 0
| = jump back to the matching '/' if the length of the input queue is nonzero 
!int(instructions) = if current cell is not int, then skip to matching ')'
!~int(instructions) = if current cell is int, then skip to matching ')'
$func_name{instructions} = subroutine named func_name
*func_name* = run func_name subroutine
#comment# = comment (may or may not be multi-line)

Subroutine names can only include uppercase and lowercase letters as well as underscores

No defining subroutines in subroutinesâ€”that is to say, all subroutines are global.

Input will be in the form of an iterable which will be converted to a queue.
E.g. a list, string (if you only want to input chars), Queue, etc.
Input values can be of type char, int ( < 256 ), or binary byte ( <= 0b11111111 )

There will be infinite cells in either direction each of which can hold 8 bits, or one byte.
That is, an integer from 0 to 255, inclusive.  If a cell is incremented while its value is
255, its value wraps to 0.  If a cell is decremented while its value is 0, its value
wraps to 255.
